**Abstract:**  
This post explores the challenges of finding truly uncensored AI models, noting the influence of OpenAI's data and built-in "guardrail" limitations. It discusses methods for fine-tuning base models to remove such refusals, referencing Eric Hartford's approach, and shares the author's experience with some specific models, including one found to be particularly responsive.

I've found that many AI models seem to be built using data that **comes** from OpenAI in some way. This data often includes "guardrails" â€“ built-in limitations that **stop** the model from responding to certain types of prompts. This makes finding a truly uncensored model **very difficult**.

I **read** an interesting article by Eric Hartford that explains how to fine-tune a base AI model to remove these refusals:

[Uncensored Models by Eric Hartford](https://erichartford.com/uncensored-models) (I'll refer to this as the "Hartford method" below.)

The main idea behind the Hartford method is to retrain a foundational AI model (a "base model") using a dataset that has had all the "refusal" responses (where the model says it _can't_ answer) removed. The goal is to create a model that will answer **more openly**.

However, in my own tests with a model fine-tuned this way, I found it still wouldn't answer some questions I **asked**. I need to look more closely at the filtered dataset Eric Hartford used to understand why this might be happening.

On a related note, the most effective uncensored model I've personally **found** so far is [TheBloke/PiVoT-0.1-Evil-a-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/PiVoT-0.1-Evil-a-GGUF) on Hugging Face. This particular model doesn't require any special instructions (a "system prompt") **to respond**, and it seems willing to answer a very wide range of questions.

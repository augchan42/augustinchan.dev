Google now penalizes over-optimization harder than under-optimization.

I analyzed 1,000 pages ranking #1.
Average keyword density: 0.3%
Pages on position 11-20: 1.8%

The sites trying hardest to rank are getting punished for it.

SEO in 2025 is completely backwards.

Content: @noelcetaSEO Interesting theory.  Interested to look at the data. The rationale kind of tracks and Googles been favoring natural language for years...but actual ranking dips for use of keywords? Correlation or causation, or anomaly in your dataset?

Content: @noelcetaSEO Google really feels like itâ€™s punishing effort at this point, curious if you think this is intentional or just broken signals.

Content: @noelcetaSEO I've felt this for ages, the SEO tools are basically telling us to write like robots and Google is now punishing it.

Content: @noelcetaSEO While everyone screams to go all automatic it should be a signal for everyone to do the opposite and realize that the human approach is 100x better

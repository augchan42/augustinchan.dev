# Hello Nextra

Welcome to my new blog! I've migrated from Jekyll to a modern stack using Next.js and Nextra.

## Why the Migration?

After years of using Jekyll, I wanted to move to a more modern, performant stack that would give me:

- **Better Developer Experience** - Hot reloading, TypeScript support
- **Performance** - Next.js SSG with optimized builds
- **Modern Tooling** - React ecosystem, better CI/CD
- **Maintainability** - Active development vs aging Jekyll

## Technical Details

This site now uses:

```javascript
// next.config.mjs
import nextra from 'nextra'

const withNextra = nextra({
  search: {
    codeblocks: false
  }
})

export default withNextra()
```

The migration involved:
1. Setting up Next.js 15 with Nextra 4
2. Configuring Pagefind for search
3. Adding MDX support for rich content
4. Deploying to Vercel

## What's Next?

I'll be migrating my existing blog posts and continuing to write about:

- AI and machine learning
- Web3 and blockchain development
- Web development best practices
- Product building experiences

Stay tuned for more content!
